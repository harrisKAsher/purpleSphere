<p>My Name is Asher Harris and that is all you are getting... Okay maybe you are getting some more than that. I enjoy video games, of course what younger person doesn&#146;t now days. I love all forms of digital media and am good at most of them, not great but I am pretty good! I especially like to make websites such as this one and to make videos. I use to be a Let's Player on YouTube by the name of Arias3601, but those days have long past.</p>
<p>I currently do own a running website, <a href="http://metanaito.net/">www.metanaito.net</a>, it is a Kirby fan site as I am a big fan of Nintendo, specifically Kirby. I also like The Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus, and of course Smash Brothers, who doesn&#146;t like that game? If you did not know this websites design is made completely out of HTML, yea it may not look like a fancy site, but it is not designed to be, it is designed to show some of the amazing things you can do with HTML 5 and CSS 3. Have you tried highlighting some text with your cursor yet? Yep, it is awesome and purple, that is just a example of the power of CSS 3.</p>
<p>If you are wondering I have only been in Mr.Schollers Digital Media class for less than a year. First semester I was in Lancer TV and in Digital Media 1. Second semester I am in Digital Media 1 and Digital Media 2, I think I am to busy, guess that is better than being board all day. Also make sure you are viewing this in Chrome or Fire Fox, Safari may be fine as well, this will give you the best experience of the site unless Internet Explorer finally fixed itself up to be like the rest of the web browsers. Any hope you enjoy my great works!</p><br />
