<p>This website is design to show off how amazing HTML 5 is and CSS 3, while also showing off some of the amazing stuff I have made through out the year. The CSS is actually really important, I am serious, with out it all of the background would be gone. Also if you are using Internet Explorer you are not getting the full experince of the website, please use Chrome or Fire Fox or something to see some of the awesome background stuff. Also if you are using Opera some of the Audio and Video will not work, if that is not you then you are all set to experince my site!</p>

<p>Ow also make sure to look at the code to see it, this is a good place to look for more complicated code that should still make sense if you are use to HTML and CSS. I am also using LightBox 2 for my images, so click on a image and it will pop out so you can see it even better! Come on that is pretty sweet. Also if you wan't to know a bit more about me check out my about page, and please don't contact me, as I will never reply, probably because I am in Japan.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the site and have a good time!</p>
