News can get to us in so many different ways it is hard to keep track of them all. Many old ways of getting News have fallen behind and need a way to keep up, the best thing for them is to adapt to the new way. Many have already done this, newspapers can be found online, and you can listen to the radio from a mobile device or watch live TV on your computer.</p><p align="justify">With the changes some bad things have come, the quality of Journalism has dropped dramatically. Stories that would have taken a day before they would be let out to the public are being announced in minutes after they happen. The thing about this is it allows for News Stations to make mistakes because they want to be the first one to make the head line and sometimes end up over looking simple mistakes and getting the facts wrong and they miss inform the public, but in some scenarios this is a good thing that we get news so fast as it allows the public not only to react faster but be better prepared for the future.</p><h2>How can These New Ways be Profitable?</h2><p align="justify">Many may not realize it but advertising has grown a ton. You may not need to pay the TV Company to watch there channel because they have other companies that you buy from pay them to put advertisements on their channel, the same goes for Websites, Magazines, Radio, and so on. This is actually a very profitable way to do things as the consumers get things for free, the people who create the content, whatever it may be, get paid, and the advertisers get more customers for their product.</p><p align="justify">You may be still wondering if there are any better ways for future, well there is. The companies can design their websites to know what the user has looked at recently. This allows a computer to know what there interest may be in and make it so that specific adds show up for the consumer. For example if I Google a New Book ad's for that book are more likely appear while the person who did not has less of chance of seeing that ad. This is great because that means that consumers will be seeing ad's for products there are more likely to look into and buy allowing a high price to be put on the place for ad's and more money to made by those who put the ads there. This also could be implemented into other media such as TV in the future.</p></td></tr></table><br /></div></div><div id="wrapper_bottom"><div id="footer"><br /><br /><p align="center">Site Navigation</p><div align="center"><font size="-1"><a href="index.html">Index</a> | <a href="news.html">News</a> | <a href="tsa.html">TSA</a> | <a href="classes.html">Classes</a> | <a href="bio.html">Who Are We? </a> | <a href="right.html">Copy Rights</a></font></div> <br /><div align="center"><font color="#CCCCCC">&copy; Layton High School Digital Media</font></div></div></div></div></body></html>
