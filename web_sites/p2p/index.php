    <p>Welcome to Prison to Prison Triathlon, home of the only triathlon to be based around two prisons. Our triathlon is held once every year in the spring and takes place around the San Francisco bay. The triathlon features many of the beauties of the San Francisco area. The race begins at the San Quentin Prison where participants will run to Fisherman’s Wharf crossing the angelic Golden Gate Bridge on their way. From Fisherman’s Wharf the participants swim across the ocean to the historic Alcatraz Island known for its history of being the unescapable prison. Following which participants return across the sea back to Fisherman’s Wharf and begin the final trek of the triathlon. The participants then ride a bike out of the San Francisco area across the Oakland Bay Bridge, they head up north along the coast to the final stretch where they head across the John T. Knox Bridge back to the San Quentin Prison to finish.</p>
